# MidiUSB

Playing around with MIDI over USB on Arduino I ended up making a little PC-speaker-esque sound generator.

Works:

* Monophonic (no arpeggiator yet)
* Vibrato (depth and rate configurable)
* Glissando (rate configurable)

I'd like:

* Setting parameters via MIDI (should be easy, code is ready for it)
* Tone stacking (goes back to the last note if you release the last one)
* Arpeggiator (configurable speed and direction)

Maybe even:

* Other waveforms
* ADSR
